# Shdades of grey
I know, the title brings a smile to most of the readers. Unfortunately, a couple of movies around this name have actually created a different notion about this. If we recollect a couple of the most common questions we have answered in our childhood, what's your dream, and who is your role model?

Pause, think for a moment, try to recollect your answers from your childhood. Most importantly, for many of us, the answers would have changed frequently (maybe every 2 years). So, by the time you are 18. You would have definitely had a bunch of role models. Role models are people who we are looking up to. So, we back them up on everything. After a point, I realised in my life that the concept of a role model itself is so flawed that we are backing up someone on something which we might not agree upon, just for the reason that he is good at something else.

We should be very careful in choosing role models and should be very specific to a characteristic the role model exhibits. For ex., Suddha Murthy is my role model for philanthropy, and Bill Gates is my role model for passion. Now, the role models we have might be contradicting some characteristics. For example, one of your role models might be vegetarian and another non-vegetarian. In this process, we tend to forget to adopt the wonderful characteristics that he/she possessed. 

So, fundamentally we have always been categorising people/parties(say groups of people) as good or bad rather than accepting the way they are. Everyone is in the shades of grey, there is no black or white.

What happens if we accept the way they are?
Now, there is no compulsion to always agree or disagree with everything that a person says. We can evaluate our own way and then decide who is right/wrong in a situation.

So, finally, the next time you come across a person or character in a movie/story. Think of this, what is it that I can get from him which can make me a better person?
