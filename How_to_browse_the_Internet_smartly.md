# How to browse the Internet smartly?
We often open browser to do something important, while browsing we often get distracted and start doing something else and later realize that we did nothing. Here is a small analysis on use of internet which I did in order to increase my productivity of using internet.

To start off, I will quickly list down the things which most of us do in browsing net.
- Social Media: - Facebook, Twitter most commonly used. People do use Linked in and google plus even.
- YouTube: - Watching trailers, web series, stand comedy shows etc.
- Sports: - Cricbuzz, Cricinfo, Hotstar etc. mostly used.
- E-commerce: - Flipkart, Amazon, myntra etc. mostly used.
- Bill Payments: - To recharge, book bus/flight/train/movie tickets, pay water/electricity etc bills.
- Banking:- To transfer the money, keep track of money etc
- Google apps: - Maps, Drives, Translators, Calendar, Keep etc.
- TV programs/Movies: - Voot, hot star, ozee etc. to watch TV programs and to download the movies mostly via torrent.
- News/Email: - To read newspaper and watch news channels, to send and receive mail.
- Search: - Google for something which is unknown. Most of the people read Quora answers and StackOverflow (coders).
Educational Sites: - Udemy, Coursera, Udacity etc. and watch an educational YouTube channel to learn something. Which most of us doesn’t do at all

Few people do say that there is no way to use the internet smartly. Most common solution is minimizing the usage of internet which is hard to do it and hardly few say how to do it. If you are still reading this, I assure, you will find the answer here

- Maintaining to do list is the best way to complete the tasks which we had to. This completes our work soon but, this doesn’t assure us that we minimized use of internet.
- Be limitless is a chrome extension which helps you to analyse the amount of time spent on social media, search engine, YouTube etc. you can schedule your task over different websites and do many more. ( I am not promoting this extension, you can find similar extensions in the net)
- Buyhatke, Keepa are the extensions/websites which will reduce your time in finding the best price for the desired product across various e-commerce sites. These websites/extensions provide wide variety of facilities such as comparison among the products and price tracking over a period of time.
- Setting the remainders for bill payments is the best way to pay the bills on time and easily. This really helps, if you are the one who pay the bills of your entire family. Grabon,Couponsdunia etc are the sites which help you in getting the best coupons/promo codes across the various bill paying sites.
- Turn off the notifications for all the sites except which are highly necessary. These notifications most of the times will mislead us.
- People who read newspaper usually can reduce their time by following newspaper pages/news channels in Facebook and twitter. This will really help them to get the news on time.
- Using google apps such as google doc, spreadsheet, calendar, photos etc save lot of time. Ex., sharing a document among few people to edit the document can be achieved easily.
- I am not that interested in movies/web series/tv shows much. For all of those who often download the movies using torrent can make a list of sites which you use the most, searching the movie torrent in that list reduces some amount of time.
- I have seen so many people who listen to songs (music) in YouTube. I personally suggest, try using Saavn or gaana or some other app from windows store because often YouTube suggestions take us to something that not worth at that particular moment of time.
- Turn off the auto play in YouTube. When we start watching some video, we end up watching something completely irrelevant after 5-6 videos.
- I hope that the above stated points really help you in using the internet smartly
